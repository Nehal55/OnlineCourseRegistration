## Project Design
Design is the first step in the development phase for any techniques and principles for the purpose 
of defining a device, a process or system in sufficient detail to permit its physical realization.
There are five types of user involved in the process:
1.  Unauthorized Users
2.  Students
3.  Department official
4.  Hall official
5.  Register Official
6.  Admin
Functionalities are different to each user.

## Feasibility Study
A feasibility study is used to determine the viability of an idea, such as ensuring a project is legally, 
operationally and technically feasible as well as economically justifiable. Output of feasibility 
study  summarizes  results  of  the  analysis  and  evaluations  conducted  to  review  the  proposed 
solution and investigate project alternatives for the purpose of identifying  if the project is really 
feasible,cost-effective and profitable.
In this section discussed about the feasibility study of project. It includes the followingi.  Technical Feasibility
ii.  Economical Feasibility
iii.  Operational Feasibility

### i)  Technical Feasibility:
Since the project is design with PHP as code behind and MySQL as backend, it is easy to install 
in the systems whenever needed.  It is more  efficient, easy and user friendly to understand by 
almost  everyone.  Huge  amount  of  data  can  be  handled  efficiently  using  MySQL  as  backend. 
Hence this project has good technical feasibility. As per the technical aspect the project NSTU 
Admission Test Volunteering is technically suitable forth user as well as the developer.

### ii)  Economical Feasibility: 
Economic feasibility is mainly  concern with the cost incurred during the 
implementation of the software. Since the project is developed using PHP and MySQL which is 
more  commonly  available  and  even  the  cost  involved  in  the  installation  process  is  not  high. 
Similarly it is to recruit persons for operating the software. Since almost all the people are aware 
of PHP and MySql. Even if we want to train the person in these areas, the cost involved in training 
is also very less. Hence this project has good economic feasibility.

### iii)  Operational Feasibility:
As this PHP component is very easy to operate for the software engineers and easy to use. So this 
project has a good operational feasibility. Hence this project is technically, economically as well 
as operationally feasible.
